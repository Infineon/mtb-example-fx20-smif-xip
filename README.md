# EZ-USB&trade; FX20: SMIF Execute-in-Place application

This code example demonstrates EZ-USB&trade; FX20 device's capability to execute code directly from an external 
SPI flash using the Serial Memory Interface (SMIF) peripheral's Execute-in-Place (XIP) mode. <br>
In this example, the PMODE/BOOT switch is configured as a GPIO interrupt to toggle the User LED whenever the switch is pressed.
The interrupt handler signals the main application to call `Cy_HandleBootSwitchEvent()`, which toggles the User LED.
The `Cy_HandleBootSwitchEvent()` function is executed from the external SPI flash in XIP mode.

> **Note:** This code example is also applicable to EZ-USB&trade; FX10, EZ-USB&trade; FX5N, and EZ-USB&trade; FX5 devices.

## Debugging


### Using the Arm&reg; debug port

If you have access to a MiniProg or KitProg3 device, you can debug the example to step through the code.
<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

</details>


<details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.

</details>


### Log messages

The code example and the EZ-USB&trade; FX20 stack output debug log messages indicate any unexpected conditions and highlight the performed operations.

By default, the USB FS port is enabled for debug logs. To enable debug logs on UART, set the `USBFS_LOGS_ENABLE` compiler flag to '0u' in the *Makefile* file. SCB1 of the EZ-USB&trade; FX20 device is used as UART with a baud rate of 921600 to send out log messages through the P8.1 pin.

The verbosity of the debug log output can be modified by setting the `DEBUG_LEVEL` macro in the *main.c* file with the values shown in **Table 2**.

**Table 2. Debug values**

Macro value | Description
:--------   | :------------
1u          | Enable only error messages
2u          | Enable error and warning messages
3u          | Enable error, warning, and info messages
4u          | Enable all message types


## Compile-time configurations

This application's functionality can be customized by setting variables in *Makefile* or by configuring them through `make` CLI arguments.

- Run the `make build` command or build the project in your IDE to compile the application and generate a USB bootloader-compatible binary. This binary can be programmed onto the EZ-USB&trade; FX20 device using the EZ-USB&trade; Control Center application

- Run the `make build BLENABLE=no` command or set the variable in *Makefile* to compile the application and generate the standalone binary. This binary can be programmed onto the EZ-USB&trade; FX20 device through the SWD interface using the OpenOCD tool. For more details, see [EZ-USB&trade; FX20 SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/fx20)

- Run the `make build CORE=CM0P` command or set the variable in *Makefile* to compile and generate the binary for the Cortex&reg; M0+ core. By default, `CORE` is set as `CM4` and the binary is compiled and generated for the Cortex&reg; M4 core

- Choose between the **Arm&reg; Compiler** or the **GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler** build toolchains by setting the `TOOLCHAIN` variable in *Makefile* to `ARM` or `GCC_ARM` respectively. If you set it to `ARM`, ensure to set `CY_COMPILER_ARM_DIR` as a make variable or environment variable, pointing to the path of the compiler's root directory

Additional settings can be configured through macros specified by the `DEFINES` variable in *Makefile*:

**Table 3. Macro description**

Macro name | Description   | Allowed values
:--------  | :------------ | :-------------
`USBFS_LOGS_ENABLE` | Enable debug logs through the USBFS debug port | '1u' to select debug logs over the USBFS port <br> '0u' to select debug logs over the UART (SCB1)
